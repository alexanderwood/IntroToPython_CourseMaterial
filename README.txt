This repository contains the lecture slides used in my CST 1101 - Introduction to Problem Solving with Python course at New York City College of Technology. In each folder, you will find the .tex file for the slides, the .pdf file, and folders containing the images in the slides (in case you want to edit the tex file) as well as examples of python programs on that topic.
